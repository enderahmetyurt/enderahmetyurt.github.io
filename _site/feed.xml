  <summary>Hello ðŸ‘‹

A race condition happens when two or more parts of a program try to change the same information at the same time. Think of it like two people trying to edit the same document simultaneously - it can lead to mistakes and unexpected results. This often happens in programs that run multiple tasks at once, where you canâ€™t predict which task will finish first.

Common Scenarios of Race Cond...</summary>

  <summary>Hello ðŸ‘‹

When I started learning Ruby programming, I loved using if statements because they were easy to understand and could be used everywhere. However, as I built bigger projects, I noticed a problem: my code became messy and hard to understand. I had too many nested if statements, and my logic was scattered all over the place.

I learned an important lesson: writing good if statements isnâ€™t...</summary>

Ruby provides multiple ways to access Hash values. The dig method offers a safe approach for retrieving values from nested Hash or Array structures. Letâ€™s explore how dig works, along with its alternatives and key differences:

Using dig

The dig method lets you traverse nested structures by specifying a path of keys. Rather than raising an error when a key doesnâ€™t exist, it simply ret...</summary>

When I started my career, I was full of energy and saw endless possibilities ahead. But after 13 years in the same profession, something changed. Now I often wonder: Am I running out of challenges? Has my passion faded? Should I try something completely new? Whatâ€™s holding me back from growing? Why do I lie awake at night? Am I focusing on the right things? If these questions sound fam...</summary>
