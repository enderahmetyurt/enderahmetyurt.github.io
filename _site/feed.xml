Ruby is a beginner-friendly programming language but after some time, you want to have more detailed information about this language. Modules are one of Rubyâ€™s best features. I didnâ€™t have this kind of guide when I was trying to learn Ruby but you will have. This gu...</summary>

Thereâ€™s a dog barking outside, and though itâ€™s a bit distracting, Iâ€™ll manage. Iâ€™ve got my headphones on with some nice background music playing, so letâ€™s get started, Ender.
