    "content": "Hello üëãWhen I started my career, I was full of energy and saw endless possibilities ahead. But after 13 years in the same profession, something changed. Now I often wonder: Am I running out of challenges? Has my passion faded? Should I try something completely new? What‚Äôs holding me back from growing? Why do I lie awake at night? Am I focusing on the right things? If these questions sound familiar to you, keep reading.I want to share my personal journey with you. While my experience might be different from yours, I believe you‚Äôll find something valuable in this story I won‚Äôt give you a list of rules to follow or tell you when to wake up or exercise. Instead, I‚Äôll simply share how I changed and what I learned along the way.  If I hadn‚Äôt gone to university, I wouldn‚Äôt have become a self-taught programmer. I know this because I know myself.Let me explain how I got into this field. Growing up, I wasn‚Äôt particularly interested in computers, but I knew I wanted a career involving them. Although I didn‚Äôt score well on the university entrance exam (√ñSS), my family supported me in getting into my chosen school. During my studies, I discovered my true passion and learned to set goals and make plans to achieve them.  Developing software is nice, but another world is also possible.I‚Äôm naturally outgoing and enjoy connecting with people. Spending time together and sharing experiences brings me joy. I‚Äôm honest about who I am - I enjoy recognition for my work. What makes me truly happy is public speaking, organizing groups, taking the lead, and achieving goals with others. I discovered these things about myself during my university years.This self-discovery in college proved valuable for my career. School played a crucial role in my life, particularly in learning English. Though I sometimes questioned why I needed these skills, they‚Äôve become incredibly useful. Today, I can talk to people around the world. I have friends across the globe for two main reasons: my career in technology and my ability to speak English.After five years of university, I graduated with a diploma but felt uncertain about my future. What I knew for sure was that I wanted to enjoy my work. I‚Äôm the kind of person who prefers to avoid unnecessary stress and complications. I believe in working in a way that feels natural, not like a programmed robot - even though that‚Äôs not always appreciated in today‚Äôs business world. While I believe in working hard and achieving goals, I‚Äôve learned that I need to stay true to who I am. This approach might not make me the most successful person in my field, but it lets me live honestly. Yes, being myself has sometimes caused problems in both my career and personal life, but I‚Äôm okay with that. Through my mistakes, I‚Äôve learned valuable lessons.  I wanted to show people what I had done and receive their praise.Near the end of my university years, I found a programming tool called Ruby on Rails. While I had learned other programming languages like C and Java in school, Ruby on Rails was different. It let me create things quickly and easily share them with others. This was perfect for me because I loved showing my work to people and getting positive feedback.Through Ruby on Rails, I discovered the Ruby programming language and connected with people from all over the world online. Even before graduating, I was working on exciting projects and getting help from a wonderful community of developers. They taught me new things and made programming fun again. The best part was working together with others.Back in the 2010s, using Ruby on Rails on Windows computers was very challenging. To solve this problem, I started using UNIX-based systems - first Linux, then Mac OSX. This led me to spend more time at my school‚Äôs computer club.The computer club turned out to be a great opportunity. I got to lead projects, work with others, and be part of a community. That‚Äôs when I realized something important: I could combine my love for technology with my passion for bringing people together. I hadn‚Äôt known this was possible before, but once I discovered it, I found it incredibly rewarding.  I will be a man who deals with Ruby in Turkey and my name and Ruby will somehow be side by side.As I was about to graduate, I needed to find a job. My family wanted to help and suggested various corporate positions, but I had different plans. The big corporate world seemed too rigid and boring to me. Instead, I wanted to work at a startup where I could use Ruby on Rails and be part of a more dynamic environment. I also had a bigger dream: I wanted to become known as a Ruby expert in Turkey and make a name for myself in this field. This became my personal promise.Looking back, I realize I haven‚Äôt shared many technical details yet. But that‚Äôs because I understood something important: to succeed in this field, I needed to prove myself technically first. I knew I had to work hard and show my skills before anything else. This approach helped me in every job I had - I would first demonstrate my technical abilities, and then I could also showcase my other talents.I‚Äôm outgoing and direct. When I want something, I simply ask for it. This approach has worked well for me, especially in startups. I take charge of projects, follow through, and create results. I loved working with Ruby programming, and I just needed to prove myself. I‚Äôve been lucky to work with kind and supportive people who value hard work. By staying true to myself, I‚Äôve achieved my goals.While I enjoy technical work, I‚Äôm not just a technical person. Working with people energizes me. I need human interaction and leadership opportunities - I can‚Äôt thrive working alone in isolation.To help grow Ruby programming in Turkey, I helped build a community. We‚Äôve accomplished a lot together, and we‚Äôre still going strong. This community work complements my regular job perfectly. My people skills help me connect with others in the community, where I meet people from many different backgrounds. I don‚Äôt believe in isolating myself - it wouldn‚Äôt make me happy. I love being part of this community and helping others learn programming. I get positive feedback regularly and feel confident about my path.I mentioned that I love public speaking, and there are many chances to do this in tech. When I first started presenting, I was worried about what people would think. But instead of criticism, I found opportunities. Speaking led me to meet new people and opened many doors. Now I share knowledge in different ways - through talks, podcasts, videos, and blog posts. While this isn‚Äôt part of my official job description, I believe in creating new possibilities.Beyond my main job, I‚Äôve found joy in other activities like mentoring, teaching coding bootcamps, and working on open source projects. Yes, my job is to write good, reliable software - and I do that well. But why stop there? I‚Äôve found ways to add more meaning to my work while staying true to who I am.If you‚Äôve read this far, think about what makes you happy. Maybe you love coding, and that‚Äôs great! But consider exploring other options too. Sometimes we get stuck in our routines and miss opportunities around us. Take time to pause and listen to your inner voice. Keep trying new things and learning. There‚Äôs always more to discover.‚ù§Ô∏è"

    "content": "Hello! I am still working professionally with the Ruby programming language, which I first started in 2011. I love the community as much as the language itself, and I am always proud to be a part of this community. I also try to organize people and do things on my own. Additionally, I enjoy getting together with other people who are devoted to the Ruby programming language, spending time with them, and sharing information. I had the opportunity to attend Euruko, the oldest and longest-running conference series for the Ruby programming language in Europe, for the first time this year. Perhaps the time had finally come.I was very excited when Euruko was first announced because it was clear that it would be in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina. I would like to make a note here: The location of Euruko for the next year is determined by voting on the cities nominated by participants in the year it is held. Tuzla was chosen for 2024, and we, especially me, were excited. The fact that Bosnia is close and does not require a visa from Turkey was a big plus. So, I started preparations immediately.As the founder and manager of the Ruby community in Turkey, I thought we should also have a share in this event. I contacted Muhammed from the team organizing Euruko and told him that we could support him as a community. Thus, Ruby Turkey officially became one of the Community Partners of Euruko 2024. This initiative made both the community and me proud.As a community, we started to support Euruko by advertising on social media and at the events we organized, and by explaining the latest developments. We knew that we would be in Bosnia and Herzegovina with a significant number of participants from Turkey.While all this was happening, the city where the conference would be held was changed from Tuzla to Sarajevo. This did not matter to us, but when we look at it in general, we can say that it was better.I have not given a speech in English at an international conference in my career yet. I wanted Euruko to be the first and sent a speech proposal, but it was not accepted. I haven‚Äôt given a speech in international yet. I may have by the time you read this article, I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs not a big deal if the speech is not accepted. There are many conferences and my enthusiasm is high. The important thing here is to try‚Äîto have this idea, to continue to improve myself, and to look for new places to give speeches. I think that being shy and holding back doesn‚Äôt work very well. After all, no one says, ‚ÄúCome and give a speech at our conference.‚ÄùWhile making plans for the event, my current wife (who was my fianc√©e at the time) said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to Sarajevo together. I will attend the conference and you can travel. Then when we find time, we can travel together.‚Äù Thankfully, she accepted. The Bosnia-Herzegovina trip and Euruko were like a second honeymoon for us. That‚Äôs why it had such an important meaning for me and my wife.After the speakers were announced, we were very happy to see Matz among them. He is already our hero for creating a programming language like Ruby, continuing to develop it, and establishing such a community. It was great to meet him, chat with him a little, and take photos. It was wonderful to have these opportunities.Along with Matz, there were many other valuable speakers. The fact that there was a speaker I wanted to listen to and meet also increased my excitement for Euruko. My conference ticket was ready. The hotel and flights were also arranged. We were going as a large team from different cities in Turkey.Day 1I came to Sarajevo with my wife the day before the conference. I wanted to spend some time with her and go to the conference in a relaxed manner.I was excited on the morning of the conference. I knew it would be crowded, and I anticipated who I would see, what kind of speeches would be given, and most importantly, what kind of fun awaited me for three days.I would like to share a note here. Conferences are not like a university environment where you simply go and attend presentations. You have the opportunity to meet many people professionally. You see your old friends again. You get a lot of swag like stickers and t-shirts. You meet new companies. You can eat nice food and see different countries and cities.With all these expectations, I officially started the adventure of Euruko.Since I was staying at the hotel where the conference would be held, I did not have to worry about transportation. Right after breakfast, I went to the relevant place for registration, and I‚Äôm glad I did because there was an incredible line afterwards. However, the line moved quickly and soon dissipated. They probably managed it efficiently to ensure everyone made it to the opening speech. After getting my Euruko conference bag and t-shirts prepared for us, I was ready for the conference.The conference was held in three separate halls, which sometimes meant three talks at the same time. So I had already determined which talks I would attend. Of course, there were changes afterwards. Xavier Noria opened the session, and we officially started with a nice talk. I had also heard him at Balkan Ruby in April. I think he is a good narrator. I continued with Jean Boussier‚Äôs talk. By the way, since the breaks were very short, I had to leave the talks a little early. There was not much time to grab coffee and go to the bathroom. The content of Jean‚Äôs talk was good. Since the subject was interesting to me and he was someone I had heard of, his talk was also enjoyable. Since the presentation titled ‚ÄúRuby off Rails‚Äù caught my attention and I didn‚Äôt know the speaker, I decided to take a look. Erica Weistrand told us how they don‚Äôt use Rails in their company. It was an interesting talk. I didn‚Äôt attend the last talk in order to have lunch and socialize with Turkish developers. We increased our socializing a bit more in the afternoon, and I can say that we didn‚Äôt attend some of the speeches. After Dmitry Pogrebnoy‚Äôs presentation titled ‚ÄúDemystifying Debugger,‚Äù I did some networking and chatted with the developer until the closing speech. I closed the day after Irina Nazarova‚Äôs AnyCable speech and the closing session, namely Bartosz Blimke, Adrian Marin &amp; Jos√© Valim‚Äôs chat.I guess I was a little tired. Since my conference muscles were not strong, listening to presentations, socializing, and talking tired me and made me hungry. We got together with some Turkish developer friends‚Äînot all of them‚Äîand went out. We had dinner, then had a drink and chatted. Since we don‚Äôt get together much as the Ruby Turkey community, this meeting was good for us. By the way, since the weather was very cold that day, I think I caught a cold, and it passed with a runny nose and sneezing in the following days. I think I caught a cold. üòäDay 2I started the day with the tiredness of the first day but the curiosity of the second day. After a nice breakfast, I took my place in the main hall for Koichi Sasada‚Äôs opening speech of the second day. He talked about YARV‚Äôs 20 years, but I can say that I was a little tired during this presentation. Although it was only the first presentation, I think the tiredness of the previous day was still there. Afterwards, I can say that I came to my senses with Marco Roth‚Äôs beautiful Hotwire presentation. I don‚Äôt use Hotwire, but the presentation excited and enthused me. Afterwards, I listened to Yaroslav Shmarov‚Äôs presentation titled ‚ÄúRails 8 Frontend: 10 commandments and 7 deadly sins in 2025.‚Äù He gave good advice for the future. I hope I remember :) Today, I wanted to leave early for lunch and socialize a little.In my opinion, the Maple Ong presentation in the afternoon was lackluster compared to his previous presentations. I had listened to him at Euruko during the pandemic and liked him very much. I can‚Äôt say I liked him very much this time. I couldn‚Äôt attend the next speeches. Since I didn‚Äôt know Prakriti Matet and the title of his speech ‚ÄúOne does not simply‚Ä¶ rebuild a product‚Äù caught my attention, I attended this speech. It was going well at first, but I guess I couldn‚Äôt finish it because of the tiredness of the day.Jos√© Valim gave the closing speech, and I think it was the best speech of the conference. I really liked it. Maybe he talked about his own product, but it was an enjoyable speech with his narrative style and footnotes. I ran into him in the elevator on the way to our rooms afterwards and had the chance to chat a bit.The evening was spent with a DJ party and socializing. These types of events at conferences are great. There was also a karaoke party, but I didn‚Äôt want to sing much because I didn‚Äôt trust my voice, my nose was running, and my throat was a little sore.The other conferences I mentioned above are not places where you can just listen to presentations. On the contrary, they are places where you can socialize and expand your network. I think you should evaluate these and attend as much as possible.Day 3As with every good thing, the conference had come to an end on its last day. The weather had started to get colder, and I could say that there was a feeling of sadness all around. Dave Thomas gave the opening speech today. He was someone I wanted to listen to, and I am so happy that I experienced this. I was going to bring his book ‚ÄúThe Pragmatic Programmer‚Äù and have it signed, but I forgot to bring the book with me. I liked his speech. He talked about the programming languages he had learned so far and the effects they had on him. Of course, the part where he talked about Ruby was the best.Then I attended the speech of Obie Fernandez, who was also a DJ the night before. It wouldn‚Äôt be right if AI wasn‚Äôt at a conference :) My expectations from this speech were a little different, but I can still say it was fun. I attended the speech where Cristian Planas &amp; Anatoly Mikhaylov talked about how they upgraded their projects together. I don‚Äôt really like speeches by two people. It seems to have a slow rhythm. I followed the explanations because the subject interested me, but I can‚Äôt say it was very enjoyable for me.After the speeches were over, before lunch, it was time to announce the candidate cities for Euruko 2025. For some reason this year, only Barcelona was officially a candidate and prepared a presentation. However, at the last minute, Viana do Castelo from Portugal took the stage as a candidate. To be honest, I had never heard of this city before. The presentation of the city was made by showing a few places from Google. Sarajevo was also a candidate. I was thinking about it, but of course there was no chance of being selected. In fact, it turned out well. If Barcelona had been the sole candidate, there would have been no competition. The cities made their presentations and the vote was held. My vote went to Barcelona, but the winner was Viana do Castelo. It has now been officially determined that Euruko 2025 will be held in this city. I have a feeling that what happened to Tuzla will also happen to Viana do Castelo. In other words, the conference location may change since it is 70 km away from Porto. We will wait and see.After lunch, I could only listen to Kasper Timm Hansen‚Äôs ‚ÄúHow to Break into Reading Open Source‚Äù talk. This talk was a bit similar to the talk he gave at Ruby Turkey, but it seemed a bit lighter to me than the one he gave there. In terms of content, the talk he gave in the community was more intense and a bit more advanced.Now Matz was on the stage to give the talk. It was enjoyable to watch him live. Especially the introductory part of the talk was very nice. He talked a bit about the kindness of the Ruby community and the reason for this. In fact, you can understand this when you are in the community a little. I feel this almost every day. After talking about Ruby‚Äôs current situation and future, Matz‚Äôs speech ended. The hall was almost full, which was to be expected. For me, Euruko ended with this speech. Before leaving the conference, I found the people I knew, said goodbye, and wished each other to see each other again somewhere.FinalI can‚Äôt make a comparison because I haven‚Äôt been able to attend a Euruko before. I can only imagine how difficult and troublesome it is to organize such an event. That‚Äôs why I would like to thank the people who organized it again. Every conference may have shortcomings; this is normal. What is important is to correct and improve them in the coming years. I don‚Äôt know if I will be at Euruko 2025. Maybe those who went can compare it with 2024. I can say that I learned a lot from this event both personally and as Ruby Turkey. First of all, I think that being a strong community is important in organizing such events. We also had the opportunity to talk among ourselves about what we can do on behalf of the community. We took a few steps that could be taken and started to take action. We will have announcements in the coming days. Personally, I want to be at more conferences. Even if they‚Äôre not international, I want to be able to attend these in Turkey. Not just Ruby, maybe other languages, maybe more general software conferences. This way, I want to meet more people and experience more different things. Let‚Äôs see what the future brings.‚ù§Ô∏è"

    "content": "Hello! I attended Balkan Ruby 2024. I had never attended any conferences abroad. This was my first abroad conference, and I was very excited. I chose to attend Balkan Ruby as it was held in Sofia, and Bulgaria is very close to Turkey - just an hour‚Äôs flight away. I also appreciate their culture as it closely resembles ours in terms of history. Additionally, I had never been to Sofia before.I purchased my conference ticket even though the speakers hadn‚Äôt been announced yet. The speakers was‚Äôt my main concern; I was more interested in the experience. Generally, traveling isn‚Äôt my favorite activity, but as a remote worker, I aim to meet up with my colleagues at least 2-3 times a year. After getting my conference ticket, I encouraged others to join the conference in Turkey. I hoped to travel with 5-6 friends or at least meet them at the conference. I thought it would be a great opportunity to learn new things, meet new Ruby enthusiasts, and explore the city. As a Turkish citizen, I would normally need a Bulgarian or Schengen visa to enter Bulgaria, but luckily, I already had a one-year Schengen Visa. My colleagues and I met in Sofia, where we worked together during the week and attended the Balkan Ruby conference together. We had a group of 10 people from Turkey who attended the Balkan Ruby.It was excited for the first day as a local community leader in Turkey, given the chance to observe an international conference. Who knows, maybe in the future, we could organize one. The conference location changed twice, although I‚Äôm not sure why. It wasn‚Äôt a big issue, as Sofia isn‚Äôt a large city and it has a good metro public transportation system. My friend and I could easily reach the conference venue from our home.Finding the conference venue was straightforward because the organizers made a video guiding us there. Additionally, in the large building, there were many signs directing us to the conference rooms. The registration process was smooth, which I hadn‚Äôt anticipated. We received our Ruby Balkan t-shirts, which were simple yet high-quality.Coffee is crucial to us. It‚Äôs our fuel. While coffee may not always be fantastic, at least it‚Äôs free. We also have the option to drink fruit tea, black tea, and water. The food is good and tasty as well. One of the highlights is the opportunity to taste a fresh local pastry called Banitsa. As a Turk, it reminded me of our own pastry (b√∂rek), but I must say, the Banitsa was quite good.Day 1It was Friday and I had to work. I had wanted to join the conference and I worked while conference. I couldn‚Äôt be focus as I expected. I had to join a meeting as-well, so I missed some talks. It is not problem. All talks will be uploaded, and I can watch them online.The first talk was engaging, given by Irina Nazarova, the CEO of Evil Martians. This company has long been making valuable contributions to the community. In her talk, Irina provided some insights into how Evil Martians operates its consultancy.The second talk I attended was by Adrian Marin, who has been building Avo. He discussed how he transformed an open-source project into a business. I found this very interesting and even had a conversation with Adrian about it afterwards. Nearly a year ago, I closed my open-source side project, Podiscover, after two years of work. I learned a lot from this experience and shared my knowledge with Adrian. During our conversation, I suggested that I might invite him to the Uretim Bandi:Teknik podcast one day.‚ÄúSustainable OSS Development‚Äù by Bozhidar Batsov was the third talk I attended. Batsov contributes to Rubocop, the most well-known Ruby gem for the Ruby style guide. The talk focused on the main challenges of developing and maintaining an OSS project. As I‚Äôm curious about long-term open source project management, I appreciated gaining insights from Batsov‚Äôs experiences and ideas.We went to a nearby place for lunch. It was a good restaurant, very popular in Sofia. The menu was extensive, covering almost all global cuisine. I don‚Äôt remember what I ate, but it was good üôÇIn the afternoon, I was able to attend only one talk, presented by Aitor Garcia Rey about their fintech tool developed in Ruby. Unfortunately, I was distracted by an issue that I had to address at the same time, so I wasn‚Äôt able to fully concentrate on the talk. However, from what I could gather, it was an engaging presentation. I plan to revisit this talk once it‚Äôs uploaded. Observing the use of Ruby in real-world fintech cases is genuinely exciting.The final topic I want to tell is the after-party. Conference attendees, identifiable by a red bracelet, had access to free beer. The party was hosted in a cozy place, under favorable weather conditions‚Äîunlike Turkey, it wasn‚Äôt cold. We enjoyed our beers and mingled with new people.Day 2After a good night‚Äôs sleep, I was prepared for the second day of Balkan Ruby. Since it was Saturday and I didn‚Äôt have to work, I expected to focus more on the conference than I did the first day. However, that didn‚Äôt happen. For some reason, I couldn‚Äôt join the afternoon talks. Instead, I preferred to engage in discussions on various topics with new friends and explore Sofia in the daylight, as it was my last day in the city.The first talk of the day was given by Xavier Noria, the author of Zeitwerk. I was thrilled to hear about his 14 years of freelancing experiences. The title of his talk was intriguing, and his speech was equally engaging. I‚Äôm typically not one to focus heavily on deadlines, and I generally avoid giving exact completion dates for the projects I work on. From what I understood, this approach isn‚Äôt necessarily negative. At least, it works for me.Thoughtbot is a company that significantly contributes to the Ruby ecosystem. I‚Äôve followed them for many years and appreciate their valuable Ruby gems, blog posts, podcasts, and more. Dimiter Petron detailed their processes and motivations in his talk. I greatly admire their efforts.The final presentation I attended at Balkan Ruby 2024 was ‚ÄúOne Engineer Company with Ruby on Rails‚Äù by Radoslav Stankov. I admire Ruby on Rails and believe it empowers individuals to develop anything they desire. It‚Äôs a perfect framework for a solo developer. As indicated by the title, Radoslav shared his experiences using it. I found the talk enlightening as I advocate for the solo developer framework in product development.FinalIn short, it was a good conference. While there‚Äôs always room for improvement, I enjoyed my time there and gained some personal insights that I‚Äôll keep in mind for future events. I understand that organizing such events can be challenging, so I‚Äôm truly grateful to the Balkan Ruby team for making it happen. I‚Äôm looking forward to an equally amazing experience next time.‚ù§Ô∏è"
